# Rick and Morty Questions Game

The goal of this project is to implement a Rick and Morty website where fans of the show can answer random questions about the characters. 

For each correct answer the user will earn a point. The final score page will show when the user fails a question.

You can visit the website through the following link: [https://rickandmortyquestionsgame.web.app/]
